#What my project is supposed to be

My project is an LED Prom dress
I chose it because I have wanted to do something like this since I was small

#Method
I developed my project by thinking and creating
The dress lights up in a "chase" from purple to blue

(the video is in my repo)

#Final Product
The dress lights up in a "chase" from purple to blue
It is supposed to turn rainbow when I spin

#Future work
I will get the rainbow working, it was just not feasable because getting the dress and putting the LEDs on took a while.
